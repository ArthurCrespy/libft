## Introduction

C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to the highly useful standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work, implementing and learning to use them.

## How To Use

To clone and run this project, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository via HTTPS
$ git clone https://github.com/ArthurCrespy/libft
# OR clone this repository via SSH
$ git clone git@github.com:ArthurCrespy/libft.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd libft

# Run the Makefile
$ make
```

> **Note**
> The library will compile using ```clang``` by ```ar```, with flags ```-Wall -Wextra -Werror```, and will be named libft.a. An index is added by ```ranlib```.

The library is compiled and ready to use.

- [get_next_line](https://github.com/ArthurCrespy/get_next_line) - Because reading from an fd is not exciting
- [ft_printf](https://github.com/ArthurCrespy/ft_printf) - Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() are not enough
